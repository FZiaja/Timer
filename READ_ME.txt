This is a timer application that allows users to save timers (a name and a duration) to a database.
Saved timers can be run at any time.

This application was created when I was just beginning with Visual Studio.
The code is messy, but the application is functioning nevertheless.

The code needs to be refactored to follow the MVVM design pattern.
The interface needs to be cleaned up.
Some visual and auditory cues need to be added to let users know when a timer has finished running.

Ideas for additional features:

1) Allow users to set checkpoints within each timer to provide cues once a timer reaches a certain point (eg. 5 minutes left).
2) Allow users to run multiple timers at once.
